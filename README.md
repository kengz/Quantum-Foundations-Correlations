Quantum-Foundations-Correlations
================================
`Updated Feb 2015`

Research notes on Quantum Foundations: `Correlations in C3` and `Blockcode Algorithm`, from Perimeter Institute, Summer 2014.

## Status
The work on Correlations is still ongoing; The Blockcode paper is complete.
**February 2015:** First implementation of algorithm for binary BC in `C++`. Estimated complexity: `O( X!Y!2^(X-1) )` for BC of size `(X Y)`.

## Credits
Original work on Correlation is due to Wah Loon Keng, Dr. Matthew Pusey, and Dr. Tobias Fritz.
The work on Blockcode is due to Wah Loon Keng.
Our work was sponsored by the Perimeter Institute Summer Student Research program.
